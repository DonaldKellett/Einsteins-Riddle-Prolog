% A formulation of Einstein's Riddle (aka Zebra Puzzle) in Prolog (specifically, SWI-Prolog - see http://www.swi-prolog.org/) as appeared on Life International magazine 17/12/1962
% Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle

% Modelling the problem:
% - Each house is represented by the predicate house/5
% - The five houses are modelled as a(n) (ordered) list of house(Color, Nationality, Pet, Beverage, Cigaret) in the variable Houses
% - The predicate solve/2 for solving the riddle is of the form solve(WaterDrinker, ZebraOwner) where WaterDrinker is the nationality of the person who drinks water and ZebraOwner the nationality of the person owning a zebra as a pet

% Expected solution: if the problem is modelled correctly by this program then the only solution set should be:
% WaterDrinker = norwegian, ZebraOwner = japanese.

% adjacent/3 - A helper function for expressing the "directly next to" relation in a list
% adjacent(A, B, List) means that either A is directly left of B in List or A is directly right of B in List
adjacent(A, B, List) :- nextto(A, B, List); nextto(B, A, List).

% solve/2 - The main predicate for solving the puzzle
solve(WaterDrinker, ZebraOwner) :-
  length(Houses, 5),                                                          % 1. There are five houses.
